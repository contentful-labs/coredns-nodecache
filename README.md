# Coredns-nodecache [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/contentful-labs/coredns-nodecache.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/contentful-labs/coredns-nodecache)

**Warning: This is an early release. Please do not use in production**

The Kubernetes [Node-local dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns)
add-on proposes running a DNS caching server on all of a Kubernetes cluster's nodes. The suggested caching server is
[node-cache](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/tree/master/cmd/node-cache), a thin wrapper around CoreDNS, that
handles the setup & teardown of the dummy network interface & associated IPTables rules.

Coredns-nodecache is an attempt to implement node-cache as a CoreDNS plugin, rather than a wrapper. The motivations
for this are:

 *  the implementation relies only on CoreDNS Plugin API, which should be backward-compatible from version to version.
    This should make using the latest version of CoreDNS easier (see
    [kubernetes/dns #306](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/issues/306))
 *  the configuration of nodecache would be done in the CoreDNS configuration file, instead of being split between
    the Corefile and command-line parameters.

### Configuration

You can use the docker hub image available at https://hub.docker.com/r/contentful/coredns-nodecache

Configuration is done by adding "nodecache" to configuration blocks in your CoreDNS configuration file.

As the following example shows, you can use the directive in several blocks. For each block, coredns-nodecache will
add the "bind" address to the dummy interface, and create iptable rules for the IP:PORT.

```
.:5300 {
    bind 168.255.10.20
    nodecache
    forward . 1.1.1.1:53 {
        force_tcp
    }
}

.:5301 {
    bind 168.255.10.25
    nodecache
    forward . 1.1.1.1:53 {
        force_tcp
    }
}
```

### Development

Checkout this repository & CoreDNS in your GOPATH. in the CoreDNS repository, in plugin.cfg, add the following line:

  ```nodecache:github.com/contentful-labs/coredns-nodecache```

Then at the end of go.mod:

  ```replace github.com/contentful-labs/coredns-nodecache => ../../contentful-labs/coredns-nodecache```

*make* should build CoreDNS and include the coredns-nodecache plugin.

   ```
   ./coredns -plugins
   [...]
   dns.metadata
   dns.nodecache
   dns.nsid
   [...]
   ```
